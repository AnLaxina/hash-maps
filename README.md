# hash-maps
A simple implementation of the Hash Map data structure. Written entirely in JavaScript

## Note

- It can only take strings and numbers as keys. No objects, arrays, etc.
- There is NO proper resize functionality. Meaning if one were to add more keys to the hash map, it will behave.... unexpectedly
